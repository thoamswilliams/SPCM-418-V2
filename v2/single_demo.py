1_gen_single.py

Shows a simple standard mode example using only the few necessary commands.
- There will be a saw-tooth signal generated on channel 0.
- This signal will have an amplitude of 2 V and a period of 1.3 ms.

Example for analog replay cards (AWG) for the the M2p, M4i and M4x card-families.

See the README file in the parent folder of this examples directory for information about how to use this example.
